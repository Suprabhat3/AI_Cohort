# 🤖 AI Agents Repository

Welcome to the **AI Agents** repository! This project contains a collection of autonomous and semi-autonomous agents built using various AI/ML techniques and tools. These agents are designed to perform tasks ranging from simple automation to complex decision-making using reasoning and learning capabilities.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository is focused on:

- Designing and implementing intelligent agents
- Using frameworks such as LangChain, Auto-GPT, AgentGPT, or custom-built environments
- Integrating with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT, HuggingFace models)
- Handling real-world tasks like data retrieval, reasoning, planning, and execution

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` or `poetry` for package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suprabhat3/ai_agents.git
   cd ai_agents
   ```

## 🧩 Features

- Modular agent architecture
- Tool-based agent capabilities (file handling, web search, API calls)
- LLM integration (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
- Long- and short-term memory support
- Logging and observability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- LangChain / Auto-GPT / Custom agent framework
- OpenAI / HuggingFace Transformers
- Gemin / for free testing 
- FastAPI or Streamlit (optional, for UI)

## 📌 TODO

- [ ] Add GUI using Streamlit
- [ ] Add multi-agent collaboration
- [ ] Improve memory handling
- [ ] Add more tools (e.g., web scraping, APIs)
